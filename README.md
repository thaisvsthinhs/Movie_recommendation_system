# Movie Recommendation System

We combine three main approaches to build a comprehensive Movie Recommendation System:
1. **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**
2. **KNN + FAISS (Approximate Nearest Neighbors)**
3. **Content-based Filtering**

The goal is to deliver accurate and efficient movie suggestions based on user preferences, user–item ratings, and movie metadata.

## Overview
This Movie Recommendation System aims to:
- **Recommend movies** based on users’ past interactions, ratings, and genres of interest.
- **Leverage multiple recommendation algorithms** to handle different scenarios for optimal speed and accuracy.
- **Provide a simple web-based prototype** allowing users to select genres, pick a movie, and receive suggestions in real time.

## Methods

### 1. Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
- **Idea**: Utilize neural networks (e.g., MLP layers) to learn latent factors for both users and items, combining them to predict user preferences.
- **Advantages**:
    - Captures complex user–item interactions in a non-linear manner.
    - Potentially more accurate than traditional MF-based approaches if trained with sufficient data.

### 2. KNN + FAISS (Approximate Nearest Neighbors)
- **Idea**: Represent movies (or users) as vectors in a feature space; then find the nearest neighbors using **FAISS** to accelerate similarity search with large-scale datasets.
- **Advantages**:
    - Straightforward to implement.
    - **FAISS** significantly speeds up similarity queries in high-dimensional spaces.

### 3. Content-based Filtering
- **Idea**: Compare movie metadata (genre, director, cast, plot, etc.) to make recommendations based on similarity of content.
- **Advantages**:
    - Works well when user behavior data is limited.
    - Explanations are more intuitive (e.g., “Because you liked this comedy with actor XYZ…”).

## Requirements
Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** (or above). Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn faiss tensorflow
```
You may have to install the movies metadata from TMDB too :b
## Quick Start

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fuongfotfet/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Run the Web Prototype**

    - Change into the `web/main` directory:

      ```bash
      cd web/main
      ```

    - Start the Flask (or Python) application:

      ```bash
      python app.py
      ```

   By default, Flask will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` (or a similar local URL).

3. **Open the Frontend**

    - Navigate to `web/main/frontend` and open `select_genres.html` in your browser.
    - Alternatively, use the route configured in `app.py` to access the page.

***Note: The prototype only using Content-based and FAISS model***
## Prototype UI

### 1. Select Genres
![Select Genres UI](Movie-Recommendation-System-main/document/select_genres.png)

Users can pick one or multiple genres (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama) to personalize recommendations.

### 2. Select Movie
![Select Movie UI](Movie-Recommendation-System-main/document/select_movie.png)

Users can type or select a movie title from a dropdown or list to trigger the recommendation engine.

### 3. Recommendations
![Movie Recommendations UI]Movie-Recommendation-System-main/document/recommendations.png)

The system will generate a list of recommended movies based on KNN+FAISS, or Content-based approaches.
